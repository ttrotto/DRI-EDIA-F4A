# Outline
1. Welcome & Project Introduction
  - Brief introduction of the workshop goals and the project’s mission.
  - Highlight the Women+ (W+) concept and its role in promoting equity and inclusivity in forestry and geospatial research.
2. Fun Facts: Women in Forestry
  - Share inspiring stories and achievements of women in forestry and Earth Observation (EO) research.
  - Include visuals and interactive elements (e.g., polls, trivia) to engage participants.
3. Module 1: State-of-the-Art Technologies and Best Practices for EO Data Access & Analysis
- Overview of cutting-edge EO technologies and relevant tools.
- Example: Demonstrate how EO data is accessed and analyzed in your research (e.g., LiDAR, remote sensing).
- Engagement Tip for peer2peer training session: Create a hands-on task where participants try simple data access themselves
4. Module 2: The Purpose, Importance, and Benefits of Sharing Research Data
- Discuss the value of open data for collaboration, transparency, and scientific advancement.
- Examples: Highlight how sharing data has benefited your own research projects.
5. Module 3: Introduction to Research Data Management (RDM)
- What is RDM? Define key concepts and explain its significance.
- Steps Towards Good RDM: Data collection, organization, storage, backup, and sharing.
- Example: Showcase your own RDM process (e.g., organizing remote sensing datasets).
- Engagement Tip for peer2peer training session: Use an interactive worksheet where participants outline an RDM plan for a sample dataset.
6. Module 4: Research Data Repositories
- What Are Data Repositories? Define and classify types of repositories.
- TRUST & FAIR Principles: Explain transparency, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability.
- Example: Share repositories you’ve used, highlighting why they were helpful.
7. Wrap-Up & Next Steps
