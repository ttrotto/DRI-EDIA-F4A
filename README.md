*DRI-EDIA Project: Advancing Equity in Forestry: Digital Research Infrastructure and Deep Learning for All*

## News

## Vision and Mission

Develop accessible resources and training sessions that empower forestry professionals—especially women and other equity-seeking groups—with cutting-edge tools in Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) and Deep Learning (DL). By facilitating broader utilization of these open-access tools among researchers and practitioners, we aim to foster women's innovation in the forestry community.

## Goals
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a454483d-2cf2-4b9e-8dfc-b788cc338175)


## Outcomes:
1. Three workshops and peer-to-peer training sessions.
2. Deep learning models as case studies in workshops, and adhering to open science principles, we provide open access to our data, code, and pre-trained models. 
3. Github guideline documents / social media articles to democratize access to advanced computing and AI techniques for forestry professionals. 

## Repo Structure

Inspired by [Cookie Cutter Data Science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science).
