## Vision and Mission

Forestry professionals, environmental researchers, and policy makers are working together to advance digital research infrastructure and deep learning for all, and have gained significant skills to strengthen and disseminate their work in forestry research and applications through advanced computing and open science principles.

## Goals
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a454483d-2cf2-4b9e-8dfc-b788cc338175)


## Outcomes:
1. Three workshops and peer-to-peer training sessions.
2. Deep learning models as case studies in workshops, and adhering to open science principles, we provide open access to our data, code, and pre-trained models. 
3. Github guideline documents / social media articles to democratize access to advanced computing and AI techniques for forestry professionals.
